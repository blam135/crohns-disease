# Computational Modelling to Elucidate Crohn's Disease Aetiology and Perpetuation
This is the repository for my thesis work, which simulates Crohn's Disease. This codebase is 
written in Java using the [MASON library](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) and extends from the
 [ARTIMMUS simulation](https://github.com/marknormanread/artimmus). Please refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/blam135/crohns-disease/wiki)
for more information on the project, the code, and getting the simulation set up.
